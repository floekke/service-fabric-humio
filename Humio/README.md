# Humio

Setting up Humio for the examples in this repository means:

1. Sign up for [Humio Cloud or download Humio](https://humio.com/getting-started/).

2. Familiarize yourself with the concepts of [repositories](https://docs.humio.com/concepts/repositories/) and [ingest tokens](https://docs.humio.com/sending-data-to-humio/ingest-tokens/). See the [tutorial](https://docs.humio.com/tutorial/) for a quick overview.

3. Know the URL for ingesting data. For e.g. cloud it's ```https://cloud.humio.com/api/v1/ingest/elastic-bulk```.

In this folder you will also find some relevant humio assets. A [Humio dashboard](https://docs.humio.com/concepts/dashboards/) for Service Fabric that can be imported and a parser for Service Fabric Platform Events.
